# FTCL - FSAC/TSRC Chat Link

A simple bot that links two specific Discord servers' channels, and relays messages posted in either one to the other channel, creating an inter-server chat channel.

This bot was originally written back when I was first getting into programming, so don't expect pristine code or smart design choices.
